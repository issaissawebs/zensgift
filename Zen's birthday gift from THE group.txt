HAPPY BIRTHDAY ZENN!!! Today is your special day! I don't know if my letter will ruin or make your day happier but there are SOOO many things I've been wanting to tell you since our first vc after the fight. So I know this might remind you pero if you look back at our argument you'll actually or might find it kind off funny like I did, it was honestly kinda cringy reading it..Anyway, here is my message to you! I love you soooo much more than you could think of.<br>
Dear Zen, I want you to know that youre one of the most special friends I have ever had. You changed my life in good ways and in bad ways. If youre wondering why I'll explain. Now I know our argument hurt us both a lot.. But in a way it made me mature?? I guess. It made me realize a lot. And I mean a lot. You made me happier and sadder in types of ways but I'm actually so happy you exist. I'm so happy I met you. I'm so happy I'm friends with you. I love you so much Zen and I have never EVER had a single regret meeting
you. Now I know you're worrying about your life in IMMA time to time. But trust me you'll do absolutely fine. If anything goes down remember you're still a kid, and you have every right to act like one and be your "annoying" little self. Now we won't be friends forever I gaurenteer you. But I will never ever forget you. In a way, you made me a better person. I realized that I should be nicer, I should stop hurting people "for fun" it honestly isn't fun at all. I realized that what you did was better for both of us in 
ways. Please know I am so sorry for hurting you and I PINKY PROMISE you I won't ever treat you that way again. You don't deserve that. I don't deserve you. I'm just shocked that a pretty face and personality girl like you even exists. I know you could probably be humbling yourself right now but I promise you all that I am saying is true. The way I see you is the most perfect girl ever, you're talented, nice, beautiful, smart and everything one could imagine. I'm honestly not surprised you pulled KKK if ykyk..HAHAHA 
back to the point Zen. I wanna say how much I appreciate and love you. I have never in my life met a girl like you and I thank you so much for just being in my life, I love the way you talk to people, I love the way you just switch for people, I love how much you care and everything. I love you so much I hate the thought of hurting you again. I know you probably don't see me the same way you did before but I want you to know that you were and always still my best friend. I know that I have my girls Sophia and Aizen 
and you three are MY TOP ONES now I get you probably don't trust me anymore. But know I trust you with the rest of my heart I could give (God took most of it) I could never appreciate someone else the way I appreciate you. I don't even know how I can explain how much I love you. Youre an actual gift from God. Happy birthday Zen!!!💗💗😘😘🥺🥺🙀🙀🥳🥳🎂🎂🎂🍰🍰‼‼‼ - Love, Issa<br>
